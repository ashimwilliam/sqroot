          .spacer 
          
          %p Diet is very important during pregnancy, as the mother is not only eating for herself, but also for the baby. The best diet during pregnancy is one that includes plenty of protein, carbohydrates, healthy fats, vitamins, and minerals. For more specific information, please see the Nutrition section of the periodic table of pregnancy. 
        
        #panel2.content
          %h3 Nutrition
          .spacer

          %p Below is some information on the most important nutritional components during pregnancy:

          %ul
            %li
              %u Folic Acid​ 
              has been shown to prevent a birth defect affecting the brain and the spine (neural tube defects), as well as heart defects and cleft lip. It can be found naturally in leafy greens, lentils, beans, and orange juice.
            %li
              %u Iron​
              is used to make hemoglobin, helping the body to oxygenate. Not enough iron can result in a greater rate of infections, anemia, premature delivery, low birth weight, and increased fatigue of the mother. It can be found in meats, leafy greens, beans, nuts, and dried fruit.
            %li
              %u Calcium
              ​helps to develop babies' bones, teeth, heart, muscles, and nerves. It is found in milk, cheese, yogurt, broccoli, kale
            %li
              %u Vitamin D​
              helps the body to absorb calcium and assists the function of body’s nerves, muscles, and immune system.  It is found in fatty fish (salmon) as well as milk and cereal that have had Vitamin D added to them.
            %li
              %u DHA​
              (docosahexaenoic acid) is a kind of fat called omega­-3 fatty acid. It helps with fetal growth and development. It is found in fish with low mercury (herring, salmon, trout, anchovies) and it is recommended that pregnant women consume 8­-12 ounces of this fish per week. Sometimes OJ, milk, and eggs have DHA added to them. 
            %li
              %u Iodine
              helps the body to make thyroid hormones, which help body to use and store energy from food. It assists with the development of the baby’s brain and nervous system. It is found in fish, milk, cheese, yogurt, and iodized salt. 

        #panel3.content
          %h3 Birth Plan 
          .spacer

          %p Birth plans help prepare a mother for birth by allowing her to explore and prepare for any possible complications that could arise. They empower a woman to own her pregnancy and encourage communication with her care provider.

        #panel4.content
          %h3 Sleep 
          .spacer

          %p Not only is a mother eating for two, she is also sleeping for two. Poor sleep, either in quantity or quality, can impede normal immune processes and cause lower birth weights, among other complications. Mothers are advised to avoid sleeping on their backs as it may cause the uterus to press on spinal nerves as well as an important vein transporting blood between the lower body and heart.
        
        #panel5.content
          %h3 Stress  
          .spacer

          %p It can be expected that pregnancy may be a very stressful time in life.  Too much stress, however, can lead to poor sleep and increased blood pressure. Chronic stress may even contribute to subtle differences in brain development and the future development of behavioral issues. ​  Long lasting stress may influence the immune system and increase the risk of infection.

        #panel6.content
          %h3 Mental Health   
          .spacer

          %p Depression has been shown to be associated with adverse birth outcomes. ​  Some women choose to discontinue taking certain mood regulating medicines when they become pregnant. However, women who elect to stop taking these medicines were shown to be 5 times more likely to relapse.​   ​  It is best to talk to the healthcare provider to decide what is the best course of action with regards to ensuring the mother’s mental health during pregnancy. 

        #panel7.content
          %h3 Fitness    
          .spacer

          %p According to the 2008 Physical Activity Guide for Americans, pregnant healthy women should have 150 minutes of moderate­-intensity physical activity, such as brisk walking, per week. Pregnant women who had already engaging in vigorous­-activity workouts are able to continue doing that, but should do so in conversation with their healthcare providers in case it must ever be adjusted. The benefits of exercising during pregnancy include fewer pregnancy related discomforts (back pain, bloating, constipation), increased energy, improved blood circulation, and improved sleeping. 

        #panel8.content
          %h3 Environmental Health  
          .spacer

          %p While pregnant, it is best to be extra precautious regarding environmental agents. This can be practiced through washing or peeling all fruits and vegetables, avoiding lead and smoke, and informing any healthcare providers of a pregnancy before receiving any x­-rays or CT scans. If using cleaning products, be sure to wear gloves and carefully read all labels to avoid using anything labeled “toxic.”

        #panel9.content
          %h3 Education   
          .spacer

          %p It is important that a mother educate herself about the birthing process and prepare herself for any complications. Mothers must be aware of best practices for ensuring fetal health and development before they are able to follow them. Providing antenatal dietary advice to women has been shown to reduce the risk of preterm birth by 54% and increase head circumference.

        #panel10.content
          %h3 Community Support     
          .spacer

          %p At times pregnancy may be very stressful or difficult. At those times, a mother might want to call upon the help of her support system.  This can be in the form of friends and family, or she may choose expand the size of her community by calling upon the help of a professional such as a doula or a midwife. Doing so has shown to decrease a mother’s likelihood of a c-section. Also, having a companion in the delivery room, either a doula or non­-professional, has had a positive effect on her birth experience.

        %h2 BIRTH&trade; Framework
      %p
        The BIRTH&trade;
        framework is a shift in emphasis from a single solution view of the
        MCH ecosystem to a multifaceted systems approach.
        It is a move from individualism to dynamic coordination -
        and the evolution of Square Roots&trade; into a new kind of organization
        that discovers, partners, and aligns into one complete system
        comprised of multiple, complementary factors and components.
        Developed in coordination with leading labs, hospitals,
        cities, and community health providers, the BIRTH&trade;
        framework codifies best practices for a healthy pregnancy and
        shares that information with all stakeholders and includes:

            %strong Birth Plan: 
            The Square Roots&trade; research team is designing a
            Birth Plan App. The App framework will offer a decision tree to
            assist mothers in creating their plan and demonstrating how each
            decision can impact future options and outcomes. The framework
            will provide real time education to empower the mother in making

        %h2 BIRTH 40&trade;: The Coalition of Cities Improving Birth in the United States
      %p
        A comprehensive solution requires connecting what is currently a very
        fragmented maternal health ecosystem and shifting the narrative of the
        conversation. Over the next four years, the Square Roots&trade; BIRTH 40&trade;
        Initiative will connect 40 member cities and states in order to
        streamline the sharing and dissemination of best practices, innovative
        solutions, and current evidence-based research regarding how to
        improve maternal and infant health outcomes. The primary goal of
        BIRTH 40&trade; is to improve pregnancy outcomes within member cities and
        states and to empower local governments to take ownership over the
        health of expectant mothers and their newborn babies within their
        communities.
      %p
        This initiative explores new territory within the maternal health
        ecosystem, as current standards are focused at the institutional
        and clinical level without placing importance on action at the
        municipal or state levels. Square Roots&trade; has already identified 11
        U.S. cities and states focused on improving maternal and infant
        health outcomes after introducing a resolution on maternal health
        at the 2015 U.S. Conference of Mayors. Now Square Roots&trade; is targeting
        other key cities nationally that are on the cutting edge of maternal
        health as leaders to emulate.
      %p
        The BIRTH 40&trade; initiative provides community needs assessments and
        quantitative measures on the state of maternal and infant health
        in each member city and state. After the community needs assessments
        are conducted within each member city, local conferences will be held
        within those communities to share findings with the community.
        Square Roots&trade; is utilizing its BIRTH Framework to give the
        inaugural 40 cities and states access to better maternal and
        infant health care systems and resources. We will customize the
        BIRTH Framework approach within each community based off the findings
        of their needs assessment. This system will provide member cities and
        states a technology platform and products to disseminate the most
        up-to-date information on pregnancy, labor, and delivery from the
        leading labs, hospitals, cities, and community health providers to
        community stakeholders and over a million pregnant women within
        the first year. The BIRTH 40&trade; coalition will also host summits during
        the four-year commitment to further collaborate between BIRTH 40&trade;
        members to share challenges as well as best practices.
      %p
        By connecting cities and states with exemplary maternal and infant
        health outcomes to other cities in need of improvement in particular
        areas of maternal and infant health, BIRTH 40&trade; will streamline the
        ability to converse about common goals and to share and scale
        solutions to improve pregnancy outcomes. BIRTH 40&trade; is a continued
        shift to-wards cities and states as the natural coordinating and
        implementation points of greatest leverage for change. The programs
        is hoping to make moms-to-be more informed about the resources and
        options available to them through-out their pregnancy experience,
        and empower each of them to take action to do what is needed to
        give their child a healthy start to life. Furthermore, by taking
        a community-based approach, we hope that this program will spark
        a dialogue and create opportunities to share best practices and
        information with other expecting mothers and families in the
        community to improve outcomes and shift the culture of giving
        birth from a clinical episode to a celebration.

              Mayor Larry Brown, Natchez, MS

      %p
        The dynamics supporting pregnant women are not working. Maternal Health
        in the United States is not improving at the rate it should. We at
        Square Roots&trade; believe that it is because of the very fragmented medical
        ecosystem. Maternal health must be reorganized and reoriented around
        city level resources and populations. In 2015, Square Roots&trade; laid the
        foundation for this reconceptualization of maternal health when we
        pioneered the 2015 U.S. Conference of Mayors to make it the first
        conference where a resolution centered on maternal health was passed,
        encouraging cities to prioritize maternal and infant care. Mayor Larry
        Brown of Natchez, Mississippi supported this resolution, and Square
        Roots&trade; funded a pilot program in Natchez to improve the health of mothers
        and infants through an innovative city services program.

      %p
        While doulas are often thought to exist outside of a medical framework,
        they are clearly associated in lowering preterm and cesarean birth
        rates.  Understanding the importance of education and wellness and
        responding to the needs of the community, Square Roots&trade; initiated a
        doula-services program focusing specifically on improving pregnancy and
        birth outcomes among women at risk of maternal obesity and subsequent
        maternal conditions in order to improve the quality of life of mother
        and child. This initial pilot program will be expanded to include other
        city networks with poor maternal health outcomes that could benefit from
        improved coordination.
